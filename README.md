# cookiecutter-poetry-djangopackage

makes uses a `pyproject.toml` file for packaging, `poetry` for
managing dependencies and builds, and Sphinx for building documentation
from both ReST and Markdown. It also supports safety checks via bandit and 
exhaustive linting.

    $ pip install cookiecutter

Then run:

    $ cookiecutter gh:andrlik/cookiecutter-poetry-djangopackage
